# skynet-plotting

## Getting Started
Once cloned, run the following command to install required Node.js packages.
```bash
$ npm install
```
Now you can start a testing server that will automatically reload as you make changes.
```bash
$ npm start
```
To build the site, run
```bash
$ npm run build
```
which will place the bundled files in the `./dist` directory.

*Note: `npm start` is a shortcut for `npm run start`. Any `npm run <your-script-name>` command (like the two we used here) is defined in the `scripts` section of `package.json`. Take a look by yourself! In other words, these are not some magic commands that npm has built-in, but rather some convenient "scripts" that we have defined.*
